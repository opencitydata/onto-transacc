The ontology allows the representation of the annotations of diability features for a public transportation system.<br><br>
Any DISABILITY FEATURE of a THING (a STATION, a BUS STOP, a PLATFORM or an EXTERIOR ACCESS to the station) in the transportation system can be annotated by a USER.  A transportation DISABILITY FEATURE addresses a certain DISABILITY TYPE and people may have a cartain type of disability, e.g. visual, auditive, reduced mobility. <br><br>
An EXTERIOR ACCESS to a STATION may be an ELEVATOR or a  FOOTPASS and a footpass may have a STAIR which may be a regular stair or an escalator. A ROUTE has in general two ROUTE DIRECTIONs and STOPs belong to certain routes. METRO STOPs and TRAIN STOPs are located in a parent STATION. <br><br>
A PLATFORM belongs to a STATION for a certain ROUTE DIRECTION. A BUS STOP, PLATFORM or STATION may have different types of NOTICE: SIGN, BILLBOARD, SOUND and LUMINOUS.
