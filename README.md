# onto-transacc
Ontology that extends the Linked GTFS (General Transit Feed Specification) model, and includes accessibility features for public transportation. The current case study is related to public transportation in Madrid, specifically buses and metro systems. 

The seed for this ontology was developed in the context of the Open Summer of Code Spain 2018 (oSoc Spain 2018). The initial development was done in the repository https://github.com/oSoc18Spain/onto-transacc, but since October 2018 the main development and maintainance of this ontology will be done in this repository, jointly by OEG-UPM and CRTM, together with any other members of the community interested in this topic.
